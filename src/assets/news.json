It's been a (very) long time coming, but I've just published a few additional QoL features and tweaks for the checklists, including the long-awaited feature of being able to sort / move checklist items around! Try it out and let me know what you think! You can move checklist items by clicking the green 'Customize' button and drag-and-dropping items around."

      "content": "Following a small break due to me going through Endwalker and a busy season at work, I have an important update: XIV ToDo now supports Discord sign-ins! This means that your data is stored on the cloud instead of your local device, allowing you to sign in from multiple devices at once. This required a lot of work behind the scenes, and has two big implications: it costs me more due to the additional infrastructure, and everyone has a 'fresh slate' and will need to re-add their characters and re-do their checklists. I apologize for the inconvenience. Lastly, I now have a <a href='https://discord.gg/zfzhKhG3zj' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Discord</a> server in addition of the <a href='https://twitter.com/XIVToDo' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Twitter</a> account. As always, thank you for your support and patience!"

        "content": "Following yesterday's update, things have started to calm down a bit and the API seems to be returning slightly more consistent results. Adding characters should be a smoother experience now. That said, the API is still not 100% consistent and I am still working on stabilization before I move on to new features. Feel free to keep making full use of the <a href='/checklist'>Checklist</a> page in the meantime, since that feature doesn't rely on Lodestone. Again, thank you for your patience!"

        "published": "September 16, 2021",
        "content": "Firstly, thank you all for your support and interest! After the traction this site has gotten from a <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/powkci/overwhelmed_with_the_amount_of_content_and_not/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Reddit thread</a>, the API I use to get information from Lodestone is getting rate-limited by the amount of people trying out XIV ToDo at the same time. Unfortunately, this means that the Lodestone is returning errors and incomplete data-sets. As such, you may be unable to add a character or get a complete and accurate view of your progression until the load stabilizes. I am looking into mitigating this issue in the future, but in the meantime please try refreshing your characters again later. Thank you!"
